In the first version on my code I made three variable called number, div and answer. number is the number i was going to dividing into , div is the number that i was going to divid into number and answer is going to be a value of 1 - 10. The while loops gives the range of div number which is 1 - 10 and says to do the loop until answer is not equal to 10. If answer is 10 then the 10 values for div has divided into the value of number so that means we have the answer. if the div doesnt have a remainder of 0 then div is reset to 1 and answer is reset to 0.

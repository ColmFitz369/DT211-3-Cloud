In this version i made alot of changes. I did this because i didnt really know what to do to solve the problem, with the limited time i had. this time instead of using div i just used 1 which is declared in the for loop. in the for loop i gave the range , which was 1 - 10. I then made sure that answer did not equal to 10, because when i does you have the answer. then i said if i divides into the number without a remainder then increment answer and i. if i divides into number with remainder then reset i and answer and increment number.
